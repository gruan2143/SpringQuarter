  For my personal website <a  href="My_Personal_website.html" target="My Personal Website">"My Personal Website"</a>, because the title is "Front & Back Yard Ideas", for this topic, I can't use warm color, such as red, yellow, pink, purple. The colors should be nature, environment, calm, tranquil. The good choice should be green, blue or combined. The colors I choose for the pallete are from w3schools.org color picker. 
  For header, I used light-green (#00FFCC) for both nature and eye-catching. For main content, I used light-blue (#66CCFF) which represents tranquil and for normal content. Footer I used light-brown (#CCCC00). In this area there is not much to read, I want to have some contrast to bring people's attention for copyright&copy. I personally don't like monochromatic colors. I think combined colors
 have more choices.
